        <h3 class="italic-title">Making the hidden dynamics of the brain visible.</h3>
        <p>
            We develop algorithms that reveal how thoughts, memories, and decisions emerge from patterns of brain activity that change across time and space. Our work uses advanced modeling techniques to reconstruct and interpret these fast, complex dynamics, helping us understand cognition as it unfolds in real time.

        <h3 class="italic-title">Building AI that learns with people, not just from data.</h3>
        <p>
            Our lab designs machine learning systems that integrate human expertise directly into the loop. From neural networks that improve stroke lesion detection to adaptive psychophysics experiments, we create open-source tools that make cutting-edge research methods accessible and interactive.

        <h3 class="italic-title">Extending brain-inspired modeling to global challenges.</h3>
        <p>
           Beyond neuroscience, we apply our computational approaches to urgent environmental and public health issues. Through projects like SMARTFIRES EPSCoR, we model wildfire spread, predict air quality, and explore the health impacts of environmental change, building data-driven tools for more resilient communities.
